Hi John (test user),
</p>
<p>
The Wakefield and Tiverton & Honiton 2022 by-election polls have
just opened, but we are sorry to say that we haven't been able
to match you up with someone to swap with.
</p>
<p>
All is not lost though - you can still vote for the party you most
wish to support, or tactically for a greater good.
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for taking part - together we are making
democracy better and more representative.
</p>
<p>
All the very best,
<br>
Swap My Vote Team
