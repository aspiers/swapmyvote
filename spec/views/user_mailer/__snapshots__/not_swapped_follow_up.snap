Hi John (test user),

<p>
Thanks for taking part in Swap My Vote!

Votes for your party are in high demand; wanting to cast a vote elsewhere for
the PartyA party means that you should
have plenty of choice for potential voting partners to ensure your vote is
cast where it will count the most for you.

If you've not been able to find someone that you're willing to swap with,
then please reply to this email and let us know why. Hopefully we can improve
the system so that we can find as many suitable swaps as possible!
