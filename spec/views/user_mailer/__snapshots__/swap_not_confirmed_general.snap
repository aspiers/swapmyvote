Hi John (test user),
</p>
<p>
The General Election 2022 polls have
just opened, but I'm afraid we haven't been able to confirm your
pending swap with Jane (test user).
</p>
<p>
All is not lost though - you can still vote for the party you most
wish to support, or tactically for a greater good.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for taking part - together we are making democracy better
and more representative.
</p>
<p>
All the best,
<br>
