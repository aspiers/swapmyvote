<p>
Hello John (test user)!
</p>
<p>
Thank you for taking part in this movement to make every vote count
for more.  We’re really excited that you’re a part of this project,
using the Internet to make democracy better.
</p>
<p>
The 2022 summer by-elections for Wakefield, and Tiverton & Honiton
are on <em>Thursday, 23rd June</em>.
</p>
<p>
There is everything to play for!
</p>
<p>
If there is already someone who wants to swap votes with you, you
will have been paired up on the site. Now that the site has
introduced you to each other, it’s over to you - the system is based
on trust so please feel free to contact each other through social
media; discuss policies, news, and your hopes for the new
Parliament.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't been offered a voting partner yet, <a
href="https://www.swapmyvote.uk/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=welcome_email&utm_campaign=be2022">go
and find your partner now!</a>
You should see a list of potential voting partners on the site - you
need to choose which you would like to swap with.
<ul>
<li>Look at the polls in their constituency to see where your vote will make most difference</li>
<li>If need be, check that there is a candidate standing there (there is a link below)</li>
<li><em>Click your preferred voting partner to propose a vote swap!</em></li>
</ul>
If the swap is not confirmed within 48 hours,
you should receive an email from us saying that it has been
cancelled. This is your cue to <a
href="https://www.swapmyvote.uk/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=welcome_email&utm_campaign=be2022">choose
a new voting partner</a>. However we want to find as many people as
possible a good swap, so <strong>for the final few days of the
campaign we will be shortening the time for people to confirm a
swap</strong>.
</p>
<p>
If we all tell the people we know, it won’t be long before there’s a
critical mass working together to make votes count for more. As soon
as we can pair you up, we will email you on this address with the
details of your new voting partner.
