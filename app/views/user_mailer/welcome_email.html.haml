  Hello #{@user.name}!

%p

  Thank you for taking part in this movement to make every vote count
  for more.  We’re really excited that you’re a part of this project,
  using the Internet to make democracy better.

%p

  The 2022 summer by-elections for #{election_title}
  are on <em>Thursday, #{election_date_dm}</em>.

%p

  There is everything to play for!

%p

  If there is already someone who wants to swap votes with you, you
  will have been paired up on the site. Now that the site has
  introduced you to each other, it’s over to you - the system is based
  on trust so please feel free to contact each other through social
  media; discuss policies, news, and your hopes for the new
  Parliament.

%p

  If you haven't been offered a voting partner yet, <a
  href="https://www.swapmyvote.uk/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=welcome_email&utm_campaign=be2022">go
  and find your partner now!</a>

  You should see a list of potential voting partners on the site - you
  need to choose which you would like to swap with.

  %ul
    %li Look at the polls in their constituency to see where your vote will make most difference
    %li If need be, check that there is a candidate standing there (there is a link below)
    %li <em>Click your preferred voting partner to propose a vote swap!</em>

  If the swap is not confirmed within #{swap_validity_hours} hours,
  you should receive an email from us saying that it has been
  cancelled. This is your cue to <a
  href="https://www.swapmyvote.uk/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=welcome_email&utm_campaign=be2022">choose
  a new voting partner</a>. However we want to find as many people as
  possible a good swap, so <strong>for the final few days of the
  campaign we will be shortening the time for people to confirm a
  swap</strong>.

%p

  If we all tell the people we know, it won’t be long before there’s a
  critical mass working together to make votes count for more. As soon
  as we can pair you up, we will email you on this address with the
  details of your new voting partner.
