  Hi #{@user.name},

%p

  The #{election_event_title_with_year} polls have
  just opened, but we are sorry to say that we haven't been able
  to match you up with someone to swap with.

%p

  All is not lost though - you can still vote for the party you most
  wish to support, or tactically for a greater good.

%p

  Thank you very much for taking part - together we are making
  democracy better and more representative.

%p
  All the very best,
