      Are you able to vote in the Chesham & Amersham by-election

      = succeed "," do
        %strong today

      or in Batley & Spen on 1st July?

    %h2

      If so, you still have time to find a voting partner to swap
      with, if you haven't already!

    %h2.subdued

      You can swap your vote with someone in the other constituency
      where it could count for more. You get to vote for who you
      really want, and to help someone else do the same!
