          We will match you with someone who will 
          cast your preferred vote in a different area where it will count for more.
          In return, you will cast their preferred vote in your area.

        %h2 How does Swap my Vote work?

        %p 1) Choose the party you would ideally vote for, and the party that you are willing to vote for tactically in your local constituency.

        %p 2) We’ll find you a list of people with the opposite preference. Pick a partner to swap your vote with (the polls can help you see where it will make most difference).

        %p 3) If your partner agrees to the swap, it is confirmed. We’ll put you in touch with each other’s Facebook or Twitter profiles and, if you like, you can introduce yourselves.

        %p
          Now that the election polls are open, Swap my Vote is closed for new swaps.

          Thank you for taking part - together we are making democracy better and more representative!
        %p
          If you've haven't had a confirmation via email that your vote has been
          swapped, we're sorry to say we weren't able to pair you with a voting partner on this occasion. All is not lost though - you can still vote tactically, or for the party you most wish to support.
        %p
          Till next time,

          All the best from the Swap my Vote team.
