      %h2 It's time to vote!
      %p

        Now that the election polls are open, Swap My Vote is
        closed for new swaps.

      - if current_user&.swap_confirmed?
        %p

          But that doesn't affect you since you managed to

          = link_to("confirm a swap", user_path)

          \- congratulations!

      - else

        %p

          If you've haven't had a confirmation via email or web that
          your vote has been swapped, we're sorry we weren't able to
          pair you with a voting partner yet.  However, all is not
          lost - you can still vote tactically, or for the party you
          most wish to support.

      %p

        Thank you so much for taking part - together we are making
        democracy better and more representative!

        Till next time,

        All the best from the Swap My Vote team.
