      %h2 It's time to vote!
      %p

        Now that the election polls are open, Swap My Vote is closed
        for new swaps.

        %strong
          There is a chance we'll be able to reopen shortly,

        so keep checking back - but that requires some frantic
        coding on little sleep, so we're not making any promises.

      - if current_user&.swap_confirmed?
        %p

          But that doesn't affect you since you managed to confirm a
          swap - congratulations!

      - else

        %p
          Either way, thank you so much for taking part - together we
          are making democracy better and more representative!

          If you've haven't had a confirmation via email or web that
          your vote has been swapped, we're sorry we weren't able to
          pair you with a voting partner yet.  Even if we don't reopen
          today though, all is not lost - you can still vote
          tactically, or for the party you most wish to support.

        Here's how to get to your
        = link_to("local polling station",
                  "https://wheredoivote.co.uk/", target: "_blank") + "."
        Get out there and vote!

      - if current_user&.swap_confirmed?
        %p
          And please don't forget to come back here when you've voted
          and
          = link_to("let your swap partner know you've voted!",
                    user_vote_path)

        Till next time,

        All the best from the Swap My Vote team.
